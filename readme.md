The purpose of this project is to track UAVs in infrared footage. the inspiration behind this project was a conversation with a friend who works at Lockheed Martin. 
After a couple hours of going over the logic and ideas behind the project I decided to use it as the capstone project for my Bachelor's Degree in Information Science at 
the University of Colorado. 
This project was created in Jupyter notebook which has the cell functionality. Because of this it may be difficult to run this code in othe IDE's.
