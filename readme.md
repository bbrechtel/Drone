The purpose of this project is to track UAVs in infrared footage. the inspiratiion behind this project was a conversation with a friend who works at Lockheed Martin. 
After a couple hours of going over the logic and ideas behind the project I decided to use it as the capstone project for my Bachelor's Degree in Information Science at 
the University of Colorado. Will add more.
